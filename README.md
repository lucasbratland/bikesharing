# Bikesharing

## Purpose
The purpose is to use the data for bike rentals in August of 2016 in NYC to determine if starting a bike rental service in Des Moines would be a smart idea. 

## Results
Here is the [link to story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucas.bratland/viz/ChallengeWork/Story1 "link to the story") for this data

### Story Summary Page 1
This is a breakdown of the total number of riders. For the month of August there were 2,344,224 total rides. Of those rides, 81.07% were by subscribers. There is about a 4:1 subscribers to random customer ratio.  

### Story Summary Page 2
There are three visualizations on this page, all of which show that the riders of the bikes were mostly males. The pie chart shows that 65.28% of the riders were males, with 25.10% female and 9.62 unknown. The 2 heatmaps reflect this as well, with all the green and white points falling in the male columns. The heatmaps also show most of the darkest reds in the unknown gender column to reflect the lowest rider percentage. 

### Story Summary Page 3
This page is a breakdown of the most busy times of the day. The heatmap is showing that thursday between 5-7pm is the busiest time of the week, followed by thursday 8am and Mon/Tues between 5-7pm. The horizontal bar chart backs this up by showing that the busiest hours are between 5-6pm and the 8am hour. This would lead me to believe that this is used heavily by work commuters. 

### Story Summary Page 4
This page is used to show the average trip duration. The most common trip duration is 5 minutes long. This observation is carried over to the gender breakdown as well. The greatest male trip duration is 5 minutes and the females is 6 minutes. 

## Summary
Most subscribers use the bike shares as a way to commute to work, but will utilize them on the weekends as well. This service is mostly used by males.


## Potential Future Analysis
A detailed analysis will need to be done to compare the demographics of people in the Des Moines metro area with those in the NYC metro. As well as a population density mapp of the Des Moines area. New york is a very dense populous, so we would need to see if Des Moines is close to the same density.
